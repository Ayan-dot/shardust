## Shardust - A distributed and thread-safe key-value cache service (fully in memory!)

[`shardust`] is a distributed cache service using [`etcd`] as a key-value store and provides a thread-safe, scaleable cache server framework out-of-box. The current iteration allows for locally hosted cache servers sharded by key; this can be scaled bidirectionally in the future. For information with regards to how it works, please contact ayan.hafeez@uwaterloo.ca

Do note [`shardust`] is a work in progress; functionality is implemented regularly.
